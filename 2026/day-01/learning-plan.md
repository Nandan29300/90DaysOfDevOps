# 90-Day DevOps Learning Plan

## 1. My Current Level  
I am currently a **working professional** who is new to DevOps. I have experience working in the IT industry, but I do not have hands-on experience with DevOps tools and practices. I am motivated to transition into DevOps with a structured and disciplined approach.

## 2. My Understanding of DevOps and Cloud  
I understand DevOps as a culture that focuses on collaboration between development and operations teams, automation of processes, and continuous delivery of software. It is not just about tools, but about building reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.  

Cloud Engineering, as I understand, involves using cloud platforms like AWS to host, manage, and scale applications instead of relying only on traditional infrastructure.

## 3. Why I Am Starting This Journey  
I am learning DevOps because I want to move toward a more technical, automation-driven, and high-impact role. I am interested in building systems, improving deployment processes, and working with modern cloud-native technologies. I also see DevOps as a strong career path with growing industry demand.

## 4. My 4 Goals for the Next 90 Days  
1. Gain strong hands-on knowledge of Linux, Git, and Docker by working on real tasks.  
2. Build and deploy an application on AWS with proper CI/CD automation.  
3. Deploy and manage a basic application using Kubernetes and understand its core concepts.
4. Be recognized as a DevOps Hero in TrainWithShubham community.

## 5. 3 Core DevOps Skills I Will Build  
- Linux administration and troubleshooting  
- CI/CD pipeline design and automation  
- Containerization and Kubernetes fundamentals  

## 6. Weekly Time Commitment  
- **Weekdays:** 2–2.5 hours per day (after work - If I get time, else will complete whenever I get free time)  
- **Weekends:** 4–6 hours per day (This is for sure.... I will dedicate my weekends to learning and practicing DevOps skills. Even kai functions, marriages last month se meine chod diye :-< ) 

## 7. How I Will Stay Consistent  
- I will **TRY** to follow a fixed daily study schedule after work.  
- I will focus on hands-on practice rather than only watching tutorials.  
- I will take notes and document what I learn.  
- I will track my weekly progress and adjust my plan if needed.  

## 8. Where I Want to Reach After 90 Days  
After 90 days, I want to be confident with Linux, Docker, AWS basics, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes fundamentals. My goal is to be ready to apply for entry-level DevOps roles or internal DevOps opportunities in my current organization.
