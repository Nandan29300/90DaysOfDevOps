# Day 27 – GitHub Profile Makeover: Build Your Developer Identity

## Profile: [github.com/Nandan29300](https://github.com/Nandan29300)

---

## Task 1: Profile Audit

Visited my own GitHub profile as a stranger and assessed the current state.

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Profile picture professional? | ✅ Yes |
| Bio filled in? | ✅ Yes — Software Engineer at Kambala Solutions Pvt Ltd |
| Pinned repos relevant? | ✅ Showing key projects |
| Repo descriptions present? | ✅ Main repos have descriptions |
| Would a recruiter understand my work? | ✅ Yes — portfolio, LinkedIn, Twitter, dev.to all linked |

---

## Task 2: Profile README

Already have a profile README at `github.com/Nandan29300/Nandan29300`.

**README includes:**
- Introduction — who I am, current role at Kambala Solutions
- What I'm working on — 90 Days of DevOps + full-stack development
- Skills and tools — JS, TS, React, Python, Docker, Linux, Bash, AWS, and more
- Tech arsenal with icon badges
- GitHub stats and activity graph
- GitHub snake contribution animation
- Open source badges (Holopin)
- Contact section — Gmail, LinkedIn, Twitter

---

## Task 3: Repository Organization

| Repo | Status |
|---|---|
| `90-days-of-devops` | Created — daily challenge submissions organized by day |
| `VCETBot` | Existing — AI virtual assistant for VCET college |

All repos have:
- Descriptive names using hyphens
- One-line descriptions on GitHub
- README.md explaining contents
- Relevant `.gitignore`

---

## Task 4: Pinned Repositories

Selected 6 pinned repos that best represent my work:

1. `90-days-of-devops` — active DevOps challenge, shows daily commitment
2. `VCETBot` — real-world AI assistant project (JavaScript)
3. `Travel-Frontend` — frontend JavaScript project

---

## Task 5: Cleanup

- Reviewed all repos for `.env` files, API keys, and hardcoded secrets — none found
- Archived old or irrelevant repos that were empty or abandoned
- Confirmed all active repos have descriptions set on GitHub

---

### 2 Things Improved

1. **Added 90-days-of-devops repo and pinned it** — Created a dedicated repo for the challenge with a clear folder structure by day. Pinned it so visitors immediately see the active learning project.

2. **Security audit** — Scanned all repos for exposed `.env` files, API keys, and hardcoded passwords. Confirmed no sensitive data is publicly visible in any repo or commit history.

---

## Lessons Learned

- GitHub is a living portfolio — it should always reflect what you're actively building
- Organizing work into dedicated repos makes it easier to reference, share, and grow
- Pinning is curation — 6 well-chosen repos communicate more than 53 unlabeled ones
- Checking for exposed secrets should be a regular habit, not a one-time task
